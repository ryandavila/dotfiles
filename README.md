# dotfiles
Just some of my config files that I'll update periodically when I learn new things...

# Easy control

I currently link these using a symlink for each file, like the command shown below:

```
ln -sv ~/dotfiles/.vimrc ~
```

Maybe one day I'll write a script to auto symlink all the files in here...
